# Úa-FESOM
Úa-FESOM is a coupled ice sheet-ocean model designed to improve predictions of the Antarctic Ice Sheet's evolution over centennial timescales. The model integrates:

Úa (finite element ice sheet model)
FESOM-1.4 (finite element ocean model)

By leveraging horizontally unstructured grids in both components, Úa-FESOM enables high-resolution simulations of key ice-ocean interactions while maintaining computational feasibility.

The model has been applied to MISOMIP (idealized ice-ocean interaction experiments) and the pan-Antarctic & Global Ocean Domain (large-scale simulation).

The code has been developed by Ole Richter standing on the shoulders of Ralph Timmermann and his RAnGO code. Funding has been received by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Programme, PROTECT (Grant No. 869304).
